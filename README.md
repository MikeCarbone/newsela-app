# Newsela Trivia Game

This is a project developed for the technical interview process at Newsela! Let's set some goals for this project:
⬜ Use this as a [pilot](https://superfriendlydesign.systems/articles/design-systems-pilots-scorecards/) app to look for common components we can break out into a basic design system (we'll use `styled-components`)
⬜ Implement data fetching pattern to an external API
⬜ Write beautiful components
⬜ Use design tokens to fuel our components
⬜ Save our users' stats with local storage

## How to run locally

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies by running `npm install`
3. Run development server with `npm run dev`
4. You should see the project running locally at `http://localhost:3000`

### Note

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Deployed on Vercel

We'll use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) to host this project. Vercel is from the creators of Next.js.

Here is some extra [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
