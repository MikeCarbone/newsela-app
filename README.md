## Project Outline
This is a project developed for the technical interview process at Newsela! Let's set some goals for this project:

âœ… Use this as a [pilot](https://superfriendlydesign.systems/articles/design-systems-pilots-scorecards/) app to look for common components we can break out into a basic design system (we'll use `styled-components`)

âœ… Implement data fetching pattern to an external API

âœ… Write beautiful components

âœ… Use design tokens to fuel our components

âœ… Save our users' stats with local storage

## How to run locally

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies by running `npm install`
3. Run development server with `npm run dev`
4. You should see the project running locally at `http://localhost:3000`

### What's with the emojis? ðŸš€

I use emojis to help visualize what kind of change a commit is making. I didn't invent this. I use [Gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/) by Carlos Cuesta as a reference for which emojis to use.

### Note on API folder

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deployed on Vercel

We'll use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) to host this project. Vercel is from the creators of Next.js.

Here is some extra [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
